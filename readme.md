# Switch streaming platform

Switch is a streaming platform in the style of twitch.com that's being developped by Julia van Drunen and Ewout Eggens as a final project for the CodeGorilla bootcamp.

We set up a Raspberry Pi to function as a server/router between the OBS streaming software and our website. Please contact us for a demo, as the streaming server is not always running and OBS requires specific configuration to work.

A live version can be found on: https://i.redd.it/88di0tb6phm01.jpg
