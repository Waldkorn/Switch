# Switch streaming platform

Switch is a streaming platform in the style of twitch.com that's being developped by Julia van Drunen and Ewout Eggens as a final project for the CodeGorilla bootcamp.

We set up a Raspberry Pi to function as a server/router between the OBS streaming software and our website.

A live version can be found on: https://switch.vps.codegorilla.nl/

Our implemented user stories and planning can be found on trello: https://trello.com/b/pWdyAshY/switch
